## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN
This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of PDC-cycleGAN. Our model mainly makes modifications to the generator and loss function.

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) and 0.4+ and other dependencies (e.g., torchvision, [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) and [dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate)).
  - For pip users, please type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - For Conda users, you can create a new Conda environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
  - For Docker users, we provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile. Please refer to our [Docker](docs/docker.md) page.
  - For Repl users, please click [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)](https://repl.it/github/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).

### PDC-CycleGAN train/test
- Download a CycleGAN dataset (e.g. maps):
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh maps
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097.
- To log training progress and test images to W&B dashboard, set the `--use_wandb` flag with train and test script
- Train a model:
```bash
#!./scripts/train_cyclegan.sh
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan
```
To see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/maps_cyclegan/web/index.html`.
- Test the model:
```bash
#!./scripts/test_cyclegan.sh
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/maps_cyclegan/latest_test/index.html`.
